Cao and Nie (2017): Amplification and Asymmetry without Collateral Constraint
*****************************************************************************

`Cao and Nie (2017) <https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20150219>`_ studies a two-agent model with a borrowing constraint tied to the price of an asset with fixed supply.
It is well known that the existence of a collateral constraint amplifies aggregate productivity shocks when the shock pushes the constraint to bind.
They show that the incomplete-markets structure of the model by itself can deliver amplified and asymmetric responses of the model to symmetric productivity shocks, even without a collateral constraint.

The model is an example to show that getting the initial starting point for policy iterations and 
the solution to the boundary of the state space right is crucial in solving the model. These features can be implemented very conveniently with the toolbox.

Please see the paper for the details of the model.
