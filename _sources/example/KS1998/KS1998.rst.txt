Krusell and Smith (1998): Heterogeneous-agent Models with Aggregate Uncertainty
**************************************************************************************

The original `Krusell and Smith (1998) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/250034>`_
algorithm can be implemented with the toolbox, by transforming the optimization problem of the households to a system of first order conditions and complementarity-slackness conditions.

Though the toolbox is not designed for solving the equilibrium of this type of model directly,
since the decision problem is characterized by an equation system (the Euler equation and complementary-slackness condition) with state transition functions, it readily fits in the toolbox's framework.
One just needs an extra fixed-point loop to update the equilibrium object, which can be coded in MATLAB. 
In `Krusell and Smith (1998) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/250034>`_, the equilibrium objects are the aggregate state transition coefficients.

The model can be solved within 100 lines of GDSGE code plus 100 lines of MATLAB code.
We present the heterogeneous-beta version of the model below.
